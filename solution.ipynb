    "# Detect Overfitting or Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function to determine whether a machine learning model is overfitting, underfitting, or performing well based on training and test accuracy values. The function should take two inputs: training_accuracy and test_accuracy. It should return one of three values: 1 if Overfitting, -1 if Underfitting, or 0 if a Good fit. The rules for determination are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: The training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy (difference > 0.2).\n",
    "Underfitting: Both training and test accuracy are below 0.7.\n",
    "Good fit: Neither of the above conditions is true.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "training_accuracy = 0.95, test_accuracy = 0.65\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "'1'\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "The training accuracy is much higher than the test accuracy (difference = 0.30 > 0.2). This indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data and generalizes poorly to unseen data."
