## Introduction

This repository hosts my solutions to various problems posted on [Deep-ML.com](https://www.deep-ml.com/). Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation and code examples, primarily using Python and popular ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

These solutions are designed to:
- Enhance your understanding of key machine learning concepts.
- Provide practical examples of ML algorithms in action.
- Serve as a resource for preparing for technical interviews and real-world ML applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual folders for each problem. For example:

```
deep-ml-solutions/
├── README.md          # This file
├── problem_1/
│   ├── solution.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with code and explanation
│   └── explanation.md  # (Optional) Extended explanation
├── problem_2/
│   ├── solution.ipynb
│   └── explanation.md
├── problem_3/
│   ├── solution.ipynb
│   └── explanation.md
└── utils/             # (Optional) Common helper functions or scripts
```

Each problem folder contains:
- A **Jupyter Notebook (`solution.ipynb`)** that presents the problem, your code solution, visualizations, and step-by-step explanation.
- An optional **explanation file (`explanation.md`)** for additional details and insights.
